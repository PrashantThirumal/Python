I used python here to control a iCreate2 Roomba.
A raspberry pi was attached to the roomba and the python code was implemented on the raspberry pi to control the movements of the Roomba
The pdf files are the task descriptions

It only dawned on me after I completed the class and no longer have access to the lab that I should have uploaded videos here to show that the Roomba actually works based on my code. Retrospect is always funny in its timing. 

However I do have a video of the Roomba playing Imperial March (Project 2). Not all was lost.
