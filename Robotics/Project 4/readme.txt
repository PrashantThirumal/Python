This is an extension from project 3. The Roomba follows a wall and when it detects its dock, it will move towards the dock.
Once it is charging properly on the dock, the program terminates and plays a song. 

Pitfalls.
If the Roomba is approaching the dock perpendicularly, it will not dock. 
Instead it will just drive over the dock. (It is pretty hilarious actually)
I believe the reason is that the docking method makes very small adjustments in its movement.
I did not have enough time to test out the values or try another logic to get the docking to work 100%.

For example: Could have used another PD controller for the docking function but then again how would you determine a set point?
